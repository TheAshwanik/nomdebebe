## Motivation

I need to choose a name. There's lots of tools and apps out there to help with that, but I want a tool that **doesn't spy on me and sell my data** (or yours for that matter). Unfortunately, it seems the only way for that to exist anymore is to build it yourself, so here we are.

## Features

* Fully private—there is no tracking / spying / advertising / etc
* Baby names from over a century of records
* Quick swipe each name right or left to like it or dislike it
* Filters to let you hone in on the type of name you want
* Share your list with a partner and figure out your top names together
* Light, dark, and OLED black themes for night-time browsing
* Open source ([licensed under Apache-2.0](LICENSE))—fork away!
